**Netflix Data Analysis**

Netflix is a media-services provider and production company headquartered in Los Gatos, California. It was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph. Netflix initially started as a DVD-by-mail service before launching its streaming platform in 2007, which has since grown to become one of the world's leading online streaming services with over 200 million subscribers in more than 190 countries.

I have collected the data from Kaggle and did the analysis. The data includes the subscribers, revenue and prices of the platform. The app shows the analysis of data in various aspects on how gradually the netflix app is growing. All of the data was in suitable form so there was no needed to clean. I only had to choose which variables would be useful in my analysis.

In recent years, Netflix has faced increasing competition in the streaming space, with the entrance of new players like Disney+, Apple TV+, and HBO Max. Analysing the data would help the company to know where they are lacking behind and can improve in that particular area as per customer satisfaction.
